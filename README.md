# Prediction of Heart Disease Risk With Using Machine Learning

Predicting whether patients have a risk of heart disease or not

# Abstract

In this project, machine algorithms were applied using the heart disease dataset, which
are variables such as age, gender, cholesterol, and a prediction model was created with
classification.
The aim of this study is to create a model that predicts whether a person has heart disease
or not, based on the variables entered.
Data was analyzed by data visualization and information about the characteristics of the
variables was obtained.
Appropriate methods and algorithms were examined and learned. Algorithms such as
Logistic Regression, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural
Networks, were applied, and model validation and tuning processes were performed for
each. The models of all algorithms were compared, and the best algorithm was determined
with measurement metrics such as Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix.
The Python code written to make this project was created using Seaborn, Matplotlib,
Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas libraries.
